Hi there,

Thanks for your contribution in Hacktoberfest and in helping others make their first contributions to open source.

SOLVE THIS ISSUE

The goal is to make a website which has functionalities of ICloud and LMS both made for a specific university say "Demo College".
There should also be a chatbox included in this website.

Since this is begineer friendly, you can add many more things which you want.
