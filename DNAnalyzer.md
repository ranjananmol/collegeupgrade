New to open source and Hacktoberfest '22?
Looking for eligible repositories which you can contribute to? Meet DNAnalyzer.

**DNAnalyzer**
> A highly efficient, powerful, and feature-rich algorithm for analyzing DNA sequences

**Repository: **https://github.com/Verisimilitude11/DNAnalyzer

The current algorithm just finished thorough testing with DNA samples from a variety of species. DNAnalyzer identifies proteins, amino acids, start and stop codons, high coverage regions, regions susceptible to neurodevelopment disorders, transcription factors, and regulatory elements in DNA strings. Researchers are working to extract valuable information from such software to better understand human health and disease. 

**Ways to Help**
I'd be grateful for any help, whether in testing, science, code, formatting, accessibility, or anything else. If you know __**Java or a similar language**__, your assistance with adding new features would be greatly appreciated (including a CLI and GUI). Similarly, if you are more **__familiar with biology__**, I (and the rest of the team) would appreciate feature requests and bug reports. It even has scopes for those who want to contribute to documentation / no code. You can open issues regarding features or bug reports, and I will add `hacktoberfest` label if appropriate. If you want to take over any issues, just comment there and I'll assign you with the task. In any case, even if you aren't interested in contributing, please visit the repository and **__give it a star__**. The developer team is excited to see the flow of pull requests in the coming weeks!
